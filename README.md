# SNSentiment
Perform sentiment analysis on SNS (Reddit) posts using NLTK and
TextBlob. Next, link the results to the posts. A new model using
TF-IDF represents posts and sentiment scores as vectors. Input
sample text to this model and verify whether it is correctly judged.
Practice a method called ensemble learning or stacking.
